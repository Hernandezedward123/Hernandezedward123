##  Advantages of Having on Site storage room or online storage 
-Disadvantage can be environment, power, space, cost etc. 
## Concepts and Terminology  
-Cloud is a distinct IT environment for remotely provisions of scalable and measured It resource 
-Hardware-based or Software base 
-Can have server rooms and have dictated equipment and bases for the Cloud Servies 
-Can handle the scaling for increase and decrease usage demands 
-Client and the way to access  
## Goal and benefits 
-Reduce cost for investment and proportional costs (have to purchase the licensing usage and misusage can be led to legal stuff)
-They can accommodate client demand by allocating storage (having the capacity for over usage such as release dates, cyber-Monday, sales having the ability to handle --when it peaks and drops.) How well it handles traffic 
-Availably and reliability
## Risk and Challenges 
-Increase to Vulnerabilities (on site server room reduces Security vulnerability) 
Government control 
-Industry standard (can set the base rate for the same software without need to communicate with one another) 
-Legal issues and Regulatory (firewalls for the software if It’s on site if it’s not they can access it easy) 
-2.9 video that explains the Laas
## Infrastructure as a service
-Pay for what you need instead of buying big ticket items (advantages that could go live right aways) ISS from Microsoft that can allow you to open a server
-(SaaS) 
-(Software as a service is software with a recurring cost or subscription (subscripting for the service) 
-(If he has to keep paying for Evernote and when he stops paying it no longer works then yes) 
-Iaas will manage CPUs, RAM, Storage capacity
